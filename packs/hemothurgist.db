Abilities gained at later levels lists the levels next to their names.</p>\n<h2>ANCESTRY AND BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>In addition to class features you gain at 1 st level, you</p>\n<p>Have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>\n<h2>INITIAL PROFICIENCIES</h2>\n<p>At 1 st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>ARCANE SPELLCASTING</h2>\n<p>Using your own blood as Arcane sigils through sheer fortitude and dedication, You can cast Arcane spells using the Cast a Spell</p>\n<p>Activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells, because you're a hemothurgist, you can usually Replace material components with your own life force, so you don't need A material component pouch.        <img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Each day you can cast up to two 1st-IeveI Spells. You must know spells To cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature.</p>\n<p>The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a Hemothurgist, your number of spells per day Increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on table 1-2; Hemothurgist Spells per Day later in this PDF, Some of your spells require you</p>\n<p>To attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies</p>\n<p>Roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your Key ability modifier is Constitution, your spell attack rolls and DCs use your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<h3>HEIGHTENING SPELLS</h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, You can fill those slots with with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your repertoire at the level you want to cast in order to heighten it to that level. Many spells have specific Improvements when they are heightened to certain Levels. The signature spells class feature lets you Heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:left\">CANTRIPS</h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special Type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to the highest level spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level Hemothurgist, your cantrips are 1St-leveI spells, and as a 5th level Hemothurgist, your cantrips are 3rd -level spells.</p>\n<h2>SPELL REPERTOIRE</h2>\n<p><br />The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell Repertoire. At 1 st level, you learn two 1 St-level Arcane spells of your choice and five arcane cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the Arcane spell list or from other arcane spells that you have access to. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire, by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (See table 1-2), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same level.</p>\n<p>At 2 nd level, you select another I-st level spell; at 3 rd level, you select two 2 nd -level spells, and so on. When you add Spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it would not give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3>Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire.</h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want To replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. This spell can be a cantrip. You can also swap spells out by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>CHOSEN ARTS</h2>\n<p>You have selected and perfected a specific art for your hemothurgry practices, giving you unique abilities compared to other casters. At 1 st level, you select a Chosen art, the ones Presented in this PDF are, Mage, Transfusionist, And Flagellant.</p>\n<p>You learn a Scarlet Technique, Scarlet Techniques are</p>\n<p>A type of Focus Spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a Focus Spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 focus point. You refill your focus pool during your daily Preparations , and you can regain 1 Focus Point by</p>\n<p>Spending 10 minutes sitting down and meditating.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never Hold more than 3 points.</p>\n<h3>Mage</h3>\n<p>You have devoted your mind and body to unlocking and altering the magical properties of blood magic.</p>\n<p>Instead of gaining a new skill, you become Expert in Arcana, and gain the Sanguine Amplify Scarlet Technique</p>\n<h3>Transfusionist</h3>\n<p>You chose to study the properties of blood both magical And mundane and bend it to assist you and your allies.</p>\n<p>You become trained in Medicine and gain the Transfusion Scarlet Technique.</p>\n<h3>Flagellant</h3>\n<p>You have found yourself enthralled at the sight of a bleeding foe and wish to extend the length as much as you can.</p>\n<p>You become trained in Intimidation, and gain the Blood Pierce Scarlet technique.</p>\n<h2>ICHOR EXCHANGE : 1ST</h2>\n<p>You powers draw from your very blood to become Ichor, A powerful catalyst in your hemocraft. Ichor is a type Of trait used in various focus spells or feats you will Gain accompanied by a damage die (d4, d6, and d8), whenever you cast A spell or use an ability with the Ichor trait, you take damage equal To one die per spell level (for example, a 3 rd level spell with Ichor D6 would deal 3d6 damage), if an ichor ability is not linked to a spell, it will have a listed Amount instead (Ichor 3d6 for example), this damage is only temporary, At the end of your next turn, you regain the damage dealt as hitpoints, This does not count as  receiving healing, if you are damaged before regaining These hitpoints, they are lost as you fail to recall the Ichor back into your body.</p>\n<h2>SKILL FEATS : 2ND</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.</p>\n<p>You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>HEMOTHURGIST FEATS : 2ND</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a Hemothurgist</p>\n<h2>GENERAL FEATS : 3RD</h2>\n<p>At 3 rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a General Feat</p>\n<h2>INEXHAUSTIBLE : 3RD</h2>\n<p>The cost you take on your body has made you develop a Resistance. When you roll a success at a fortitude save against a spell or ability that would give you the drained condition, you get a critical success instead. In addition, anytime you get the Drained condition, reduce its value by 1, you take the drained damage after lowering it's value.</p>\n<h2>SIGNATURE SPELLS : 3RD</h2>\n<p>You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than it's minimum, you can also cast all it's lower level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same level at which you learned the previous spell. you can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* <span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:120%;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">The Crimson Spell feature gives you a 10th<sup> </sup>level-spell slot that works a bit Differentl from other spell slots.</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:.35pt;line-height:120%;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;margin:0cm 0cm 16.7pt 2.0pt\"> </p>\n<h2>ABILITY BOOSTS : 5TH</h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores.
